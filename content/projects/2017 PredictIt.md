## Abstract

Prediction markets are a relatively new tool for
forecasting the outcomes of paramount events such
as political elections or movements in financial
markets. Participants in prediction markets buy or
sell contracts with payoffs that depend on the
occurrence of a future event. The price of these
contracts is determined by the market of buyers
and sellers. Rational decision theory asserts that, if
market participants are rational agents, then the
price of a contract should reflect the probability of
the underlying event. Indeed, prior research has
found that forecasts based on prediction markets
can outperform forecasts based on economic
models or polling data (e.g. Rothschild, 2009).
However, individual probabilistic reasoning often
violates assumptions of rationality.
Specifically, individuals tend to overestimate the
likelihood of low probability events and
underestimate the likelihood of high probability
events (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992). Such a bias
would manifest in prediction markets as a
systematic overpricing of low probability events and
underpricing of high probability events. Here we
investigate such mispricing in the market, as well as
other sources of mispricing, across time relative to
market expiration, and discuss implications for the
accuracy of forecasts based on prediction market
data.

## Findings

We find that market price generally
overestimates the likelihood of low probability
events and underestimates the likelihood of
high probability events, consistent with
established biases in individual probabilistic
decision making. But this trend is only apparent
near expiration, and we find the opposite
pattern as we move further from expiration.
Additionally, we find strong evidence of a
neglect for fees near expiration, but only weak
evidence of such neglect far before expiration.

## Selected Figures



#### *Market Calibration*

<img class="special-img-class" src="/images/PredictIt/Figure1a.png" width="20%" style="float:right;margin:0px 50px" HSPACE=”100”/>

This figure describes the market calibration by days before expiration (x-axis), price of the market (y-axis), and proportion of markets resolving yes (color). 
Legend outlines the expected proportions if implied probabilities are accurate. 
Color above the legend range are market conditions which are underestimated, color below are overestimated. 
The three plots below the market calibration describe a single slice of the same figure at 30 days, 7 days, and 1 day before market expiration. 
As the market nears expiration higher probability events tend to be overestimated and low probability events underestimated.


#### *Conjunction Fallacy*

<img class="special-img-class" src="/images/PredictIt/conjunction.png" width="30%" style="float:right;margin:0px 50px" HSPACE=”100”/>


In market prices, a conjunction fallacy occurs whenever the contract price for an individual
event (e.g., “Donald Trump will win the 2016 Presidential Election”) is greater than that of a
contract that is a conjunction of that individual contract with other events (e.g., “A
Republican will win the 2016 election”).


#### *Disjunction Fallacy*

<img class="special-img-class" src="/images/PredictIt/disjunction.png" width="30%" style="float:right;margin:0px 50px" HSPACE=”100”/>

In market prices, a disjunction fallacy occurs whenever the sum of contract prices within a
market exceeds 1, which implies that the probability of the union of these events exceeds 1.
