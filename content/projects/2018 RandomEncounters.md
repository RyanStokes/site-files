## About

I worked on Random Encounteres as a lead programmer and co-designer alongside my colleages Jordan Rashid and Jonathan Lui. Random Encounters is a video game designed to help teach statistics. In the game world, playes collect minerals, craft ingots and weapons, cook food, and fight monsters. 
All of these actions follow a different pattern of unique statitistical distributions designed so that data from the game world can be studied and strategies optimized. 
A key component of Random Encounters is the data exporter, which gives the player the ability to collect nearly any type of data they want in the game. Students of statistics 
who are curious which vegetables are more fruitful in different regions of the world can design an experiment and collect data. Since nearly all collected data are based on random variables 
students will sometimes need to collect more data if differences are subtle or even consider additional factors (such as climate) which may affect the variables.

This project was such a success at UCI that for the past two years it has been used in a supplemental class on statistics in the Social Sciences. The classes were designed alongside the game 
to guide students through real statistical problems using this simulated data. A "kings library" mock journal held the research reports from students who generated real hypotheses about 
the game world, collected data, and wrote short papers describing their findings. This created an environment where students could evaluate papers with peer review, design new studies or replication studies, or build on work from past journals. 
We have found that when students are given a world to explore and collect data from, they engage more than when handed a set of example data. They are also forced to build an intuition for collecting relevant data and controlling for confounding variables. 
Students who try collecting all data are quickly overwhelmed when it comes to analysis. Thus Random Encounters attempts to educate students on statistical analysis from beginning to end. 
Student feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.

While the game is designed for undegraduate statistics research in the Social Sciences, the complexities of the random variables allow for both simple analyses for simpler hypotheses, and more complicated analysis for the most accurate answers about the world.
Further, master parameters are used to generate all distributions in the world. The professor can edit or randomize these parameters to change the unique distributions throughout.

When battling, the player has control over what armor they wear and what actions they take (attack, buff, spells, etc.). The player has the option at the end of the battle to save the battle log for later analysis.

Ores in Random Encounters are collected in mines and when combined they create a unique ingot. The properties of ores and ingots can be studied by crafting them into armor.

Cooking in Random Encounters lets you combine ingredients to produce a food item. By studying the resulting food items from the same set of ingredients the player can find expected results and optimize what starting ingredients are used.
