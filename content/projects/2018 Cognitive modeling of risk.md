## Abstract

There are many ways to measure how people manage the risk when they make decisions. A standard approach is to
measure risk propensity using self-report questionnaires. An alternative approach is to use decision-making tasks that require
people to manage risk and uncertainty in making decisions, and apply cognitive models of task behavior to infer people’s
risk propensity. We consider three commonly used questionnaires: the Risk Propensity Scale, the Risk Taking Index, and the
Domain Specific Risk Taking Scale. We also consider four widely-studied cognitive tasks: the Balloon Analogue Risk Task,
the preferential choice gambling task, the optimal stopping problem, and the bandit problem. Although these questionnaires
and decision-making tasks have been studied extensively in isolation, there has been less research comparing how they measure
risk, especially when cognitive models are used to infer parameters corresponding to risk from basic behavioral performance.
We report the results of a within-participants experiment using 56 Amazon Mechanical Turk participants, which includes
applying cognitive models to each of the decision-making tasks. Overall results, based on Bayesian inferences about the
correlations between the risk measures, show that people’s risk propensity is generally consistent within different conditions
for each of the decision-making tasks. There is, however, less evidence that the way people manage risk generalizes across the
tasks, or that it corresponds to the measures provides by the questionnaires. Our results show that even when cognitive models
are used to infer latent parameters that represent risk propensity in task-specific context, those propensities do not generalize
across tasks. This finding adds evidence to the conclusion that risk is not a unitary psychological construct.

## Findings

We used cognitive models to analyze four sequential
decision-making tasks that are sensitive to people’s propensity
for risk. We found stable individual differences within
tasks for model parameters corresponding to the psychological
variables of risk and consistency. However, we found little
evidence for commonality or stability when we compared
conceptually similar parameter across the tasks. In addition,
we found little evidence for any meaningful relationships between
the model-based measures of risk and standard widelyused
questionnaires for measuring risk propensity based on
self-report. Our results contribute to the discussion about
howcognitive process models of sequential decision-making
tasks can be used to measure risk, and whether risk propensity
is a stable psychological construct that can be measured
by cognitive behavioral tasks.
