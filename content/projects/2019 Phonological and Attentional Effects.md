## Abstract

For all readers, visual word recognition starts with the identification of individual
letters within a word. Early readers will scan letters from left to right, converting each
letter from its orthography to its phonetic translation until the word is ’sounded out’.
Skilled readers, however, rapidly decode letter identity and position from only a single
fixation lasting around 200 ms (Rayner, Slattery, & Bélanger, 2010). The mechanisms
responsible for encoding the identities and positions of letters in fluent readers are the
subject of some debate. For example, the amount of information provided by each letter
is not equal, and while existent theories generally agree that letters are processed in
parallel (Adelman, Marquis, & Sabatos-DeVito, 2010; Coltheart, Rastle, Perry,
Langdon, & Ziegler, 2001; Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, & Patterson, 1996;
Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989), there is strong evidence that the efficiency of
processing is dependent on letter position (Davis, 2010; Whitney, 2001).

## Findings

Elements of the first letter advantage were investigated using the whole word
paradigm across two experiments. In Experiment 1, homophone pairs of pseudowords
and consonant strings were used to investigate phonological effects of letter position as
measured by relative accuracy and reaction times. Two conditions were used for
comparison, a matching condition, where target and foil strings had a matching
phonology and a differing orthography, and a mismatching condition, where target and
foil differed by both phonology and orthography. In Experiment 2 a letter was
randomly selected and colored red to act as an attentional distractor for the other
letters, and compared against trials without distractors. Three conditions were used for
comparison, an attended condition, including all trials where the attended letter
matched the modified letter position, a non attended condition, including all trials
where the attended letter did not match the modified letter position, and a no
distractor condition, where no attentional distractor was used.
Key findings are summarized here: (1) The first letter advantage was reduced in
words with an attentional distractor, but not with a matching phonology. (2) Counter
to previous reports (Aschenbrenner et al., 2017; Scaltritti & Balota, 2013), the fixated
letter had an advantage in pseudowords and words. (3) Performance for the fixated
letter was reduced in words and pseduowords when the fixated letter was not the 
attentional distractor, and in pseudowords performance was reduced when the target
and foil had matching phonology. (4) Drawing attention to the divergent letter in the
second position consistently improved the accuracy of the second letter position across
all types of stimuli.

The findings for the first letter advantage reported are largely in agreement with
previous research. We report a weak phonological effect on the first letter for
pseudowords in line with Kinoshita et al. (2018) and consistent with other phonological
priming studies which have found only marginal effects of phonology (Rastle &
Brysbaert, 2006). For attention, we report that the distracted condition in words reduce
the accuracy of the first letter position by around 6%. While the size of the effect is not
large, it reduces the pattern of accuracy in the first and third position down to a level
that is approximately linear with the rest of the letter positions. As previously
discussed, a downward left-to-right reduction in performance is thought to be due to
efficiency of processing at each letter position independent of the first letter advantage
(Adelman et al., 2010). Removing the source of the first letter advantage can only
theoretically reduce the effect to a baseline efficiency level. For numbers, consonants,
and pseudowords, no comparable decrease was found in the non attended condition.
From the context of word recognition models, a word stimulus activates a lexical
representation of the whole-word and feeds back information about letter identity (e.g.
Coltheart et al., 2001). A route not available to nonword stimuli. The first-letter
advantage in words, may be from an automatic attentional process for left-to-right
reading that doesn’t need to "turn off" unless presented with an attentional distractor.
Conversely, the nonword stimuli does not disconnect its attention from the first position
when presented with a distractor since there is no lexical activation to supplement
identification.

The effect at fixation, reported in most letter-in-string paradigms (e.g. Tydgat &
Grainger, 2009), has consistently been reported as absent from the whole word
approach (e.g. Scaltritti & Balota, 2013), leading some to suggest the two paradigms
measure differ processes (Aschenbrenner et al., 2017; Scaltritti & Balota, 2013). Using 
the whole word approach, we found a consistent pattern of fixated letter effects across
both experiments, within pseudowords as well as words. We have not identified the
source of the discrepancy, but since the effect is considerably weaker in the whole word
paradigm, and absent still for number and consonant strings, we agree that the
measured processes are not identical, but more related than previously assumed.

Interestingly, the surprise effect at the fixated letter for pseudowords was
eliminated in the matching phonology condition in Experiment 1, and the fixated letter
effect for words was eliminated in the non attended condition in Experiment 2. A
same-different task using a similar approach saw no evidence of a phonological effect at
position 3 (Kinoshita & Norris, 2009).

As seen in Experiment 2, shifting attention to the letter in position 2 improved
accuracy in words and pseudowords, an improvement not seen for any other letter
position, including the first. A parallel may be drawn between this finding and the
second letter effect found in Winskel et al. (2018), where Thai words and nonwords with
an initial phoneme in the second position had a higher accuracy compared with other
letter positions. Since they also found an initial letter position effect in words and
nonwords with an initial phoneme in the first position, an adaptive attentional
mechanism sensitive to the initial phonological letter is likely. Similarly, the increased
accuracy at position 2 found in Experiment 2 suggests that this adaptive mechanism is
also amenable to English, but not without an attentional prime. Interestingly, attention
to other letters does not improve the accuracy or reaction time in words or pseudowords.

Our findings of the first letter advantage are largely aligned with previous studies.
We found littler evidence of a phonological advantage of the first letter position across
consonants and pseudoword conditions, and stronger evidence for an effect of attention
at the first position on words, but not for number strings, consonant strings, or
pseudowords. Importantly, the lack of effect for nonwords is not evidence against an
attentional mechanism for a first position advantage. Not only could the attentional
distractor have insufficient saliency with respect to the proposed draw of the first
position, but the attention between the first position and any other position could also
be divided. As discussed earlier, the proposed mechanisms accounting for the first letter
advantage are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and may be explained by a
combination of the attentional account proposed by Aschenbrenner et al. (2017) and the
MRFH.
