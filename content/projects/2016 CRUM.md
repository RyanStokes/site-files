Children are notoriously fearless; running across slippery
grass, eating bugs, and climbing up to the top of trees while
their anxious parent yells at them to get down. Research on the
development of risk propensity suggests that as we get older,
risk aversion increases. However, there is little research on risk
aversion within the preschool age range. The current study introduces
the Child Risk Utility Measure (CRUM), a developmentally
sensitive, dynamic task that measures risk propensity.
We develop a novel cognitive modeling perspective to interpret
our behavioral data and segregate the effects of risk propensity,
probability learning, contaminant processes, and age effects
within a unified framework. Unlike previous studies of
risk propensity, we found reasonable evidence suggesting that
preschool-aged children do not become more cautious as they
get older. Any effect of age was attributed to confounds due to
contaminant behavior. We suggest this as an alternative explanation
for age effects in risk propensity during early childhood.

## Findings

We introduce a novel, developmentally sensitive, task which
provides us with detailed information regarding an individual's
risk aversion and behavioral consistency. We also contribute
to the literature on cognitive modeling of BART-like
tasks. Incorporating censoring provides more realistic inferences
about risk propensity that allow us to improve the
quality of predictions. Adding a regression model within
the Bayesian inference framework allows us to infer hyperparameters
that directly capture and compute Bayes factors
for age-effects. Unlike previous studies of risk propensity,
we found reasonable evidence suggesting that preschool-aged
children do not become more cautious as they get older. Although
our data did show an apparent age effect, the effect
disappeared when we excluded data representing contaminant
behaviors (clicking consistently and losing every trial).
It seems likely that this behavior arises either because children
do not understand how the task works, don’t have the
goal of maximizing stickers (perhaps because getting caught
by Oscar is more fun), or even because they perseverate on
clicking on the cookie jar. We substantiate this claim about
contaminants by explicitly incorporating a mixture model that
models a contaminant process and provides a likelihood estimate
of whether observed behavior is more likely to have
been generated by excessively high risk propensity or by
the contaminant process. We find evidence for the latter.
Excluding these contamia nant children explains away the
age effects. Applying our methods to reanalyze studies that
have found age effects could reveal whether these are real or
caused by some confound, and provide a Bayesian estimate
of the age-effects.
A key finding is that most children seemed to explicitly learn
and adjust their beliefs about the probability of getting caught
on any click. We also found individual differences in the children’s
risk propensity levels. Differences in risk propensity as
well as the level of learning could stem from personal traits,
environmental factors, or both. In the future, we plan to test
older children, and to add measures of executive function, in
order to determine the particular factors that give rise to individual
differences in risk propensity and learning.
