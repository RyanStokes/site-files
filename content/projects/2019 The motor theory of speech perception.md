## Abstract

Recent evidence suggests that the motor system may have a facilitatory role in speech perception during noisy listening
conditions. Studies clearly show an association between activity in auditory and motor speech systems, but also hint at a causal
role for the motor system in noisy speech perception. However, in the most compelling "causal" studies performance was only
measured at a single signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). If listening conditions must be noisy to invoke causal motor involvement, then
effects will be contingent on the SNR at which they are tested. We used articulatory suppression to disrupt motor-speech areas
while measuring phonemic identification across a range of SNRs. As controls, we also measured phoneme identification during
passive listening, mandible gesturing, and foot-tapping conditions. Two-parameter (threshold, slope) psychometric functions
were fit to the data in each condition. Our findings indicate: (1) no effect of experimental task on psychometric function slopes;
(2) a small effect of articulatory suppression, in particular, on psychometric function thresholds. The size of the latter effect was 1
dB (~5% correct) on average, suggesting, at best, a minor modulatory role of the speech motor system in perception.
